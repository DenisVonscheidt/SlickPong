SlickPong
=========

Java Pong clone realized using Slick2D.

This Project is for learning Slick2D. It should later on allow 3 different game modes:
  - Player vs. Computer
  - Player vs. PLayer on a single PC
  - Player vs. Player via the Network.

The basic Pong Game is based on a Tutorial which can be found here: http://blog.mynotiz.de/howTo/slick/Slick%20Tutorial%20-%20Einstieg%20in%20die%20Spiele%20Entwicklung.pdf
